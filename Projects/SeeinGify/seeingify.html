      <h1>Problem Statement</h1>
     <p>

      <h1>Our Solution</h1>
     <p>
      we wanted to make dating and making friends easy and quick with the people nearby.
      <br>
      our idea was to create app where users could meet their potential dates or friends whom they might just crossed on roads or maybe stores etc. and it could be accessed easily through a smart watch based app. we found out using bigger devices on the go is a task in itself

        <h4>Challenge 1</h4>
        <h1>Helping Users to relocate.</h1>
        <p>Creating easy-to-understand data visuals for users was a goal that helped drive this project as far as it did. I solved this issue by adding simple banner to the nearest hotels or pg's available at the internship location mentioned in the application.

        <h1>Style Guide</h1>
        <p>
            Utilizing bold yet calm colors felt like the perfect fit for Seeingify branding. The gradients and blacks helps evoke a premuim feeling out of users , and paired with the black it creates a nice balance between calm and energetic. The main typeface of choice for the app is montserrat. It gives the premium feeling to the users and it's extremely versatility for small and big fonts.

        <p>
            Being involved in more than 5 internship till now myself, working on Finterno  was incredibly rewarding. I got to experiment with some of the new features, and narrow down my design process. learnt more about the users frustration over the cluttered designs tried my best to avoid clutter while keeping the useful Information down the line.
